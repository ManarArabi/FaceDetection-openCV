# FACE-DETECTION WITH OPENCV
## project description
the enhancements made on an image affect the accurcy of face detection algorithm greatly  
so this project provides a set of tools that allow the user to apply multiple filters on  
a given image and tune their parameters before applying face detection to the image  
so based on the type of the image you want you can tune the parameters of preprocessing  
enhancement steps to get better results

## current features
the current version is only able to able each enhancement and face detection on its own
so we currently support:
	1 - Face detection  
	2 - Blurring  
	3 - Sharpening   
	4 - Lighting  
	5 - Gamma correction  
	6 - Equalization  
	7 - Edge detection  
some of those are added for future purposes

## tests
1 - **Face detection**:

## Future work
1 - allow parameters tuning for ach enhancement.  
2 - add more useful enhancement.  
3 - add more precise face detection methods.  
4 - allow successive application of filters to test the over all effect of applying filters on face detection accuracy.
